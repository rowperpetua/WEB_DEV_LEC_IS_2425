##3. HTML Elements and Tags Used

## 3. HTML Elements and Tags Used

In my portfolio, I utilized various HTML elements and tags to structure the document effectively. Here are some key components:

- **Document Structure**: 
  - The `<html>` and `<body>` tags establish the foundation of the document. 
  - I included meta tags within the `<head>` section for character set and viewport settings, ensuring the design is responsive across different devices.

- **Title and Headings**: 
  - The `<title>` tag names my portfolio as "My Portfolio," which appears in the browser tab.
  - To create a clear hierarchy of content, I used heading tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`. These tags help organize the information, making it easier for visitors to navigate through the sections.

- **Text Formatting**: 
  - I used the `<font>` tag to specify font face, size, and color for various text elements throughout the portfolio. While I recognize that CSS is a more modern and flexible approach, the `<font>` tag helped convey my intended design.

- **Tables**: 
  - I created tables using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` tags to present information systematically. This format allows for organized data display, which enhances readability.

- **Images**: 
  - The `<img>` tag was employed to include images of my projects. I utilized attributes like `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` to manage image properties effectively.

- **Links and Navigation**: 
  - I incorporated `<a>` tags to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the portfolio easily. This provides an interactive experience.

- **Forms for Interaction**: 
  - To facilitate visitor interaction, I included forms using the `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` tags. These elements enable users to send messages or inquiries directly to me.

This structure not only presents my content in an organized manner but also enhances user experience, making it easy for visitors to explore my portfolio.
