#My Portfolio: ROW BY ROW

## 1. Description
The portfolio contains a summary of me, as an Information System student in Technological University of the Philippines - Manila (TUP-M). It includes my contact information, photos, skills, and of course, some of my finished programming projects in my entire college life (first year to third year). This portfolio was named ROW BY ROW from my name ROWELA, this means step by step growth and achievements in programming languages.

##3. HTML Elements and Tags Used

First, I utilized the <html> and <head> tags to establish the document structure, including meta tags for character set and viewport settings that ensure a responsive design. The <title> tag labels my portfolio as "My Portfolio," providing context for the page. The heading elements, such as <h1> and <h2>, organize my content hierarchically, making it easy for visitors to navigate. Also, I utilized the <font> tag to specify the font face, size, and color for text throughout the portfolio, although I recognize that CSS is a more modern approach.Tables, created with <table>, <tr>, <td>, and related attributes, serve to arrange information systematically. I used <img> tags to include pictures for my projects, using attributes like src, alt, width, and height to manage image properties. For interaction, I incorporated <a> tags for hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between sections, while <button> tags provide a clickable interface. Additionally, forms are included through <form>, <input>, <label>, and <textarea> tags, enabling visitors to contact me directly.
